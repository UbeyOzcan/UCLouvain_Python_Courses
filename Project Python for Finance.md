# Python for Finance - Project 

To obtain the certificate, the student has to build a Python project in order to apply a finance theory. The student can choose between applying the Modern Portfolio Theory as seen in the course (Case 1) or he is also free to go for another finance topic that he would like to explore (Case 2). Here is more detail about the expected outcome of the project

## Case 1 - Modern Portfolio Theory (Efficient Frontier)

If the student choose to build a python project to implement the modern portfolio theory and the efficient frontier, here the expectation :
    
    1) The final report should be a jupyter notebook,  
    2) Data must be download from a website using python (as seen during the course),
    3) Please provide a data analysis as follow :
        - Average Price and Average Return of each asset,
        - Standard Deviation of Price and Return of each asset,
        - Correlation matrix of return,
        - One graph of evolution of price or cumulative return of each asset
    4) The student has to calculate :
        - Minimum Variance Portfolio,
        - Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio,
        - Build the efficient frontier by optimization AND simulation and check if both method gives the same result,
        - Put all those element within a graph,
        - Put single average return and standard deviation of return of each asset on the graph.
    5) A small summary of the obtainer result.

Please use this following assumption :

    - No short-selling,
    - Risk Free Rate = 0

## Case 2 - Financial topic choosen by student.
If the student choose to go for another topic, here is the requirement :

    - The student has to produce all data manipulation or correction in python (you can use an external data like CSV or Excel put you have to attach it into your final project),
    - A small description about the finance topic that will be implemented,
    - A Data analysis section to explore and explain the dataset used,
    - At least one graph,
    - The project could be done using Jupyter notebook or classic python script,
    - An interpretation of the result is expected.

## How to send the project.
Student can create a github repository, put all the code and result wihtin github and send me the link.

OR

Student can send me the project within a .zip folder by email to *ozcanubey@outlook.com*
