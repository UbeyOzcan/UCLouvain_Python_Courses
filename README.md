# UCLouvain Python Course : Introduction to Python for Finance

Welcome to this introductory course about Python ! 

The purpose of this course if to give to the student a minimum set of knowledge to make them independent with the basics of Python. To achieve this, we will develop the famous Modern Portfolio Theory and implement this in Python. 

During the course, here is the topic that will be cover :

  * Basic of programming : Variable, if/else, loop, intro to Pandas and Numpy, functions.
  * Data : import and export data, summarise them, connect to an API to download stock prices.
  * Data vizualization
  * Construct the Modern Portfolio Theory and vizualize the result.

As it is an introduction to python and we want to build a reporting for the end of this project, we will mainly program using Jupyter Notebook

## General Introduction to Python
Python is a general purpose programming language widely used for Data Science, Finance, Web Development, etc .. The easy syntax and the easiness of data manipulation and modelling makes it the perfect languages for data science purposes.

### IDE (integrated development environment)

An IDE is a platform where the developer has access to some functionnalities to write code and makes it run.

For Python, here are the most used one :
 * VS Code
 * Pycharm
 * Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is very usefull to create quick and valuable reports. 

VS Code and Pycharm are better if you a looking for project development platform for bigger project.

### Anaconda Prompt

Alongside python, some very important and usefull tools come. To run your python script (***Not a Jupyter notebook***) you will need to run it into Anaconda Prompt.

Examples on how to use it will be given during the course.

## prerequisite

Please install Anaconda : [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Once the installation is done, let's try if Python is working.

### For Windows users

First, create a folder where you will work for this project. Next, in your start menu, open **Anaconda Prompt**. 

  1 - Nagivate to your folder :

```terminal
cd C:\Users\ozcan\OneDrive\Bureau\Course Python Finance UCLouvain\UCLouvain_Python_Courses
```

  2 - Open Jupyter Notebook
```terminal
C:\Users\ozcan\OneDrive\Bureau\Course Python Finance UCLouvain\UCLouvain_Python_Courses Jupyter Notebook
```
  
If you want to access to the course notebook, put them into a folder and open jupyter notebook from this folder.

### For MacOS users

First, create a folder where you will work for this project. Next, in your start menu, open **Terminal**.

  1 - Nagivate to your folder :

```terminal
cd C:\Users\ozcan\OneDrive\Bureau\Course Python Finance UCLouvain\UCLouvain_Python_Courses
```

  2 - Open Jupyter Notebook
```terminal
C:\Users\ozcan\OneDrive\Bureau\Course Python Finance UCLouvain\UCLouvain_Python_Courses Jupyter Notebook
```
