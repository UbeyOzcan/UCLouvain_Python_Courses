# UCLouvain Python Course : Introduction to Python for Finance

Welcome to this introductory course about Python ! 

The purpose of this course if to give to the student a minimum set of knowledge to make them independent with the basics of Python. To achieve this, we will develop the famous Modern Portfolio Theory and implement this in Python. 

During the course, here is the topic that will be cover :

  * Basic of programming : Variable, if/else, loop, intro to Pandas and Numpy, functions.
  * Data : import and export data, summarise them, connect to an API to download stock prices.
  * Data vizualization
  * Construct the Modern Portfolio Theory and vizualize the result.

As it is an introduction to python and we want to build a reporting for the end of this project, we will mainly program using Jupyter Notebook
